        This is Mounting
      </h1>
      <p>
      &nbsp;	&nbsp; The name is self-explanatory. Mounting is the phase in which our React
        component mounts on the DOM (i.e., is created and inserted into the
        DOM). &nbsp; &nbsp; This phase comes onto the scene after the
        initialization phase is completed. In this phase, our compone renders
        the first time. The methods that are available in this phase are: 
        <br />
        &nbsp;	&nbsp;1. componentWillMount() This method is called just before a component
        mounts on the DOM or the render method is called. After this method, the
        component gets mounted. Note: You should not make API calls or any data
        changes using this.setstate in this method because it is called before
        the render method. So, nothing can be done with the DOM (i.e. updating
        the data with API response) as it has not been mounted. Hence, we canâ€™t
        update the state with the API response.
        <br />
        &nbsp;	&nbsp; 2. componentDidMount() This
        method is called after the component gets mounted on the DOM. Like
        componentWillMount, it is called once in a lifecycle. Before the
        execution of this method, the render method is called (i.e., we can
        access the DOM). We can make API calls and update the state with the API
        response.
